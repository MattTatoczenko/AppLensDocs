## About this Detector

* This detector displays the Total App Domains Unloaded perfmon counter. This counter displays the total number of AppDomains unloaded since the start of the application. If an AppDomain is loaded and unloaded multiple times this counter would count each of those unloads as separate.
* App Domains Unloading can cause slowness in your application if your app takes a long time to load.
