## About this Detector

* This detector displays the Exception Count perfmon counter. This counter displays the total number of exceptions thrown since the start of the application. These include both .NET exceptions and unmanaged exceptions that get converted into .NET exceptions.
* Abnormal time periods are determined by finding times when there are higher than normal exception count, controlling for difference in request volume.
